GraphQL Dashboard Data Server

## Strategy

Multiple Dashboards can reuse some of the sections, for example a Cryptocurrency
Dashboard can re-use some sections from Trading and Stock Dashboard. This will
result in multiple and unique dashboard designs and layouts even though many of
the sections and resulting UI components will be reused.

Similar effect applied to sections, many of the cards will be reused by sections,
charts are a good example, 5 - 10 chart cards reused across 30 sections will
look great.
